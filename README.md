Datatouille: Personalized restaurant recommendations based on dish extraction
from the Yelp academic dataset. 

Dataset preprocessed to extract dishnames, sentiment detection, and produce dish recommendations. Runtime UI associates recommended dishes with local restaurants and displays all information in an easy-to-use web interface. 

Preprocess requires the yelp academic dataset be downloaded into a folder one directory up from the repository root

Before Runtime
